## Project description

Problem domain:

future feature: Image gallery on "/place", Button to edit contact info, Booking date validation,

## Requirements

#### MVP

- ✅ 🎯 Users should be able to view spooky spots and place a booking if logged in
- ✅ 🎯 Users should be able to view their existing bookings
- ✅ 🎯 Business owners should be able to view all bookings made for their spooky spot
- ✅ 🎯 Business owners should be able to change the booking slots available for any given day

#### Stretch goals

- ✅ 🏹 Users should be able to click the spooky spot from a map
- ✅ 🏹 Admin should be able to add new places for users to see
- ❌ 🏹 Image gallery on /:place
- ✅ 🏹 Custom icons on the map

We couldn't get the image gallery done due to time constraints. We decided as a group that it would be best to leave it as a future feature to add.
