## Gabby's Reflection

To align with the ongoing theme of “Spooky Season”, our team decided to create an app called Spooky Spots - a platform where users can book experiences such as ghost tours, paranormal investigations or other spooky adventures. We also wanted to include a “guestbook” feature, allowing users to leave comments and reviews about the places they’ve visited. 

An interactive map was a key part of our vision. We wanted users to see location markers for each spot, click on them and be directed to a ```/:place``` page containing more details and booking options. After some research, we discovered Leaftlet, which became the foundation for our homepage’s map functionality. 

When building the homepage, I encountered a challenge where I couldn’t write my queries directly within the same file as the Map component, since the Map component can only be used on the client side. To fetch the data from the database, I needed to create an API route that would retrieve the places data and render it on the homepage. Because the information we wanted to display came from a couple of tables, I had to write more complex SQL queries to combine and return the relevant data. With the help of my teammates through pair programming, I was able to successfully fetch and display the places data with all the necessary information we wanted to showcase. 

I was also responsible for building the ```/:place/edit``` page, which is accessible only to business owners. Will handled the groundwork for user validation, ensuring that only authorised users (in this case, business owners) could access the page. My task was to make sure that only specific details about a place — such as its history and description — were editable, and that any changes were correctly updated in the database. I also created the edit form for these fields. Additionally, we included a separate form for the image URL. The original plan was to allow owners to view and delete existing images directly, but due to time constraints, we had to leave that feature out. However, business owners can still add new image URLs to update their listings.

In addition to the main features I was responsible for, I also worked on styling several parts of the app, including the header and footer. Using Tailwind CSS and adding custom styles in the globals.css stylesheet, I ensured that the design was fully responsive across both mobile and desktop devices. I was also in charge of deploying the app to Vercel and configuring all the necessary environment variables correctly.

Overall, our team collaborated extremely well. From brainstorming ideas and planning the project to coding and debugging, we maintained open communication and made decisions collectively to ensure everyone was aligned. We didn’t encounter any personal conflicts — we always discussed and agreed on changes before moving forward. Although we faced some technical issues and merge conflicts along the way, we resolved them together through teamwork and pair programming.

## Place Marker Issue

One of the issues our team encountered occurred when I installed React Icons for the footer. We wanted to display the GitHub and LinkedIn logos, but this caused compatibility problems between Leaflet and React Icons. After installing the package, all the place markers on the map disappeared — the functionality was still working, but the markers themselves were invisible. At first, we weren’t sure what caused the problem, but we later discovered that this is a known issue when using Leaflet alongside React Icons. Since there wasn’t much supporting documentation available, we turned to AI tools for assistance. After some debugging and testing, we were able to resolve the issue and restore the markers on the map.
