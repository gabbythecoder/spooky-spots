## Reflection

Since it's Halloween, we wanted to build something really in theme with the season! We decided to create a booking site where users can easily find a "Spooky Spot." This includes tours, overnight stays, and paranormal activities at genuinely haunted locations. To ensure the user experience is as simple as possible, the home page features an interactive map with custom markers showing where everything is located. Users have two ways to navigate: they can click directly on a marker or scroll down to view a complete list of all the locations below the map. Once the user has selected a location, they can access a detailed page to read more about the spot's history and handle the booking process.

The initial planning phase for this assignment was very productive, setting a strong foundation during the first two days. We began by establishing our core components, which included the wireframe, database schema, setting up the Trello board, and creating supporting documentation. The wireframe was the first step, acting as our blueprint. We collaboratively designed the database schema. This involved careful consideration of how we would structure and logically store the data for all Spooky Spots. Throughout this entire process, the group worked really well together, actively incorporating each otherâ€™s opinions and technical suggestions. This approach guaranteed that every team member was aligned and invested in the final design. This collaborative groundwork minimized guesswork and set us up for a much smoother transition into the coding phase.

Overall, the coding phase was very successful, despite presenting its own set of challenges. We encountered a lot of bugs and a couple of technical roadblocks that required careful navigation. When these issues arose, we prioritized communication across the team to ensure no one was left isolated. Our strategy for overcoming these hurdles was rooted in collaboration. We frequently utilized pair programming, which proved highly effective for resolving complex issues quickly. By working together on the code, we were able to spot errors faster, debate potential solutions in real-time. We would typically hold a mini stand-up after lunch. During this meeting, the team would push all work to the repository. This also served as a moment to go over individual progress, clarify any remaining uncertainties with current tasks, and collectively prioritize the outstanding work for the rest of the day.

This assignment, and particularly the coding phase, was a valuable learning experience. Working closely with Will and Gabby, I feel like I have learned so much from them. We all gained crucial insight into the dynamics of working effectively as a group. We learned how to leverage clear communication, especially when facing roadblocks, and how to maximize our collective effort through techniques like pair programming. Successfully delivering this complex project demonstrated the importance of adaptability, shared ownership, and mutual support in a high-pressure assignment setting skills that will be invaluable in future professional endeavors.
